# eudi-infra-ci

## Overview

This repository serves as a central space for collecting Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) workflows, which can be utilized across various other repositories within the scope of EUDIW. By centralizing  workflows, it will be easier to maintain consistency, reduce duplication, and enable efficient updates across multiple repositories.

### In detail, the purpose of this repository is to:

   1) Centralize Common Workflows: Store commonly used CI/CD workflows in one place. This approach ensures consistency across different projects and facilitates easier maintenance and less administrative effort.

   2) Promote Reusability: Encourage the reuse of CI/CD patterns and practices. Teams can leverage existing workflows, leading to quicker setup times and less duplication of effort.

   3) Streamline Updates: Enable centralized updates. When a workflow is updated in this repository, all dependent repositories can automatically benefit from the latest changes.
